#+TITLE: Computational Primitives
This file contains the 
* General Field
  - Has an integer n dimensions
  - Has a given extent over space in each direction
  - Has a d_i discretization over each dimension, leading to...
  - prod_{i=1}^{n} d_i number of cells where d_i is the discretization
  - can be rolled out into a straight array
  - each cell has a general element associated with it
  - boundary conditions allow accessing elements outside of the field
    - rules for the values returned are supplied by a boundary condition object
** Tensor Field (Skip for now)
*** Scalar Field
    - Field elements are scalars
**** Electric Field
     - Field elements are real values
     - Field elements interact via the Lorentz force
*** Vector Field
    - Field elements are vectors
**** Magnetic Field
     - Field elements are real vector valued
     - Field elements interact via the Lorentz force
* General Boundary Conditions
  - Maps a supplied index to an index within the field
  - In bounds accesses simply access the field element
  - OOB accesses are handled according to a function 
** Dummy Boundary Conditions
   - Throws an exception on an OOB access
** Periodic Boundary Conditions
   - Maps an OOB access back into the field modulo each dimension
** Fixed Boundary Conditions
   - Maps an OOB access to a fixed value on the boundary
